### Question 7: Top #Nth longest P90 travel time Location for FHV

Prerequisites:
* Create a staging model for FHV Data (2019), and **DO NOT** add a deduplication step, just filter out the entries where `where dispatching_base_num is not null`
* Create a core model for FHV Data (`dim_fhv_trips.sql`) joining with `dim_zones`. Similar to what has been done [here](../../../04-analytics-engineering/taxi_rides_ny/models/staging/stg_green_tripdata.sql)
* Add some new dimensions `year` (e.g.: 2019) and `month` (e.g.: 1, 2, ..., 12), based on `pickup_datetime`, to the core model to facilitate filtering for your queries

Now...
1. Create a new model `fct_fhv_monthly_zone_traveltime_p90.sql`
2. For each record in `dim_fhv_trips.sql`, compute the [timediff](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/time_functions#time_diff), in seconds between dropoff_datetime and pickup_datetime - we'll call it `trip_duration` for this exercise
3. Compute the **continous** `p90` of `trip_duration` partitioning by year, month, pickup_location_id, and dropoff_location_id

For the Trips that **respectively** started from `Newark Airport`, `SoHo`, and `Yorkville East`, in November 2019, what are **dropoff_zones** with the 2nd longest p90 trip_duration ?

- East Village, Chinatown, Garment District
- East Village, Park Slope, Clinton East
- East Village, Saint Albans, Howard Beach
- East Village, Rosedale, Bath Beach
- East Village, Yorkville East, Greenpoint
