Question 6:

Write a query to retrieve the distinct VendorIDs between tpep_dropoff_timedate 03/01/2024 and 03/15/2024 (inclusive)

Use the materialized table you created earlier in your from clause and note the estimated bytes. Now change the table in the from clause to the partitioned table you created for question 4 and note the estimated bytes processed. What are these values?

Choose the answer which most closely matches.

    12.47 MB for non-partitioned table and 326.42 MB for the partitioned table
    310.24 MB for non-partitioned table and 26.84 MB for the partitioned table
    5.87 MB for non-partitioned table and 0 MB for the partitioned table
    310.31 MB for non-partitioned table and 285.64 MB for the partitioned table
